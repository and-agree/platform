Descision making solution.
This webapp allows for the creation and management of company decisions.
All decisions are managed via email communications.

## Developer requirements

- GCP account with Firebase +
  Google offers a large capacity of free usage, however a card is required onfile to unlock features such as functions.

- SendGrid account +
  SendGrid offers a free capacity of emails, make sure to register a domain to the account and setup the inbound parser.

- Node 14 +
  Recommed installing Node using Brew (macOS) or Chocolatey (Windows). Preference is to use the current LTS edition supported by Firebase Functions.

- Angular 12 +
  Recommend installing this globally using `npm i -g @angular/cli` once Node has been setup.

- Firebase tools +
  Install this globally using `npm i -g firebase-tools` once Node has been setup.

- Java 11 +
  This is required to run the local Firebase emulators which are configured to be used.

Once the above have all been installed / configured, perform the following steps;

- Install dependencies +
  Using the command `npm install` from the root directory note that there is a postinstall step which will iterate and run the install on the subdirectories too.

- Login to firebase +
  Using the command `firebase login` this will launch a browser to login with your google / firebase credentials.

- Create a hosting environment file +
  Duplicate the file `hosting/src/environments/environment.ts` and rename it to `environment.local.ts` populate this with the appropriate values for your firebase environment.

- Create a functions environment file +
  Inside the `functions` folder create a file called `.runtimeconfig.json` insert the below json along with the approprite values for your sendgrid account.

```json
{
  "sendgrid": {
    "api_key": "SENDGRID_API_KEY",
    "domain": "EMAIL_DOMAIN_NAME"
  }
}
```
- Run the application +
  To run locally use the command `npm start` this will launch the firebase emulator from which you can access the emulator suite in a browser on http://localhost:4000 and then choose which area to use.

- Watching for changes +
  Function changes require a restart of the emulator, once the emulator is launched if making changes, there is an `npm run build:watch` command in the hosting folder that can be run in another terminal session to auotmatically rebuild the frontend.
